Providing high quality software isn’t just a business proposition about trying to keep customers loyal and mitigate potential frustration from end-users that use your system. Though business goals focused on financial elements are inherently significant; of equal importance is the consideration required when designing software that requires user risk insulation. Thoughtfully designing tests to verify security and functional requirements is of immediate and future interest as the project evolves. Understanding the functional requirements and level of security needed by the client is paramount to achieving a product that will provide adequate protection for the user and a positive user experience. When designing software, requirements serve as a roadmap that guides your design decisions. For this reason, it’s important to continually question requirements as the project evolves and the user’s needs change.
